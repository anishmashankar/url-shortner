# URL Shortner
URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a uniform resource locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect on a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "http://url.ext/blah/foo/bar/index.php" can be shortened to "http://yo.co/bar".
Several examples of URL shortners include Bit.ly, TinyUrl.com, goo.gl and lot more
